## installation

Clone the repo:  
``` bash
git clone https://github.com/Ben-Malin/handyFoam.git
```

Run the setup script:  
``` bash
cd handyFoam && ./setup
```
(just adds a couple of lines to ~/.bashrc)

Then source bashrc to update the environment variables and you're good to go:
``` bash
source ~/.bashrc
```

## How to use

Basically what's in the gif above - use the handyFoam command to get a series of prompts about the case you'd like to setup.  
Make selections with the number keys.  
For the extras menu, press a number again to remove it from selection.
